assisi: another somatic signature simulator
-------------------------------------------

## What is it?
`assisi` is a python package that simulates mutational signature profiles (i.e. counts / proportions of trinucleotide context mutations) using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Required / useful files
We've included the cosmic mutational signatures probabilities from deconstructSigs (https://github.com/raerose01/deconstructSigs).

## Running assisi
`python assisi.py -h` for help.  

###Typical usage: `
The following command will generate a single mutational catalog with 1000 total mutations.
`-r` specifies that assisi should generate a random number of signatures (1-10) and assign
random proportions to each of those ten signatures. The sum of the proportions is 1.0, with some error.
`-i` is the COSMIC SBS96 mutational context probabilities; each row is a signature, and each column
is the proportion of that mutational context in the signature.

```
python assisi.py -i cosmic_file.tsv -n 1000 -r
```

Rules for COSMIC sig files:  
    No headers  
    Tab separated  
    No restriction on number of rows  
    There must be 96 columns (for now)  


The next version of assisi will use a tidy format for this data.

The output of assisi when run as above is a single line with the following columns:  
```
<number of signatures> <Python dictionary of signature : proportion> <first context count> ... <last context count>
```

Multiple catalogs can be generated by wrapping the call to assisi in a BASH loop:
```
for i in `seq 1 1000`
do
    python assisi.py -n <NumMutations> -r -c cos_sigs.txt >> catalog_${i}.tsv
done
```

## Installation
`assisi` is written in barebones python2.7 - no installation necessary.
